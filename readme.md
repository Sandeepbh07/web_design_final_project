Following design considerations were adopted in this project:

1.Proximity:
Related elements are grouped together in the header and other sections, such as navigation items and the links that correspond to them.

2.Contrast:
Readability is improved by a high contrast between the text and background colors. For example, easy reading throughout the website is ensured by using dark text on light backgrounds.

3.Typography:
Headings and body material are written in easily accessible fonts. Content that is easily visible on a variety of devices is ensured by using appropriate font sizes and spacing.

To ensure accessibility compliance, the following strategies were implemented:

1.Semantic HTML:
When semantic HTML components are used properly, screen readers may understand the information with accuracy.

2.Alt Attributes:
Every image has a descriptive alt tag to help users with screen readers or with disabled images.

3.Keyboard Navigation:
All material on the website can be accessed by individuals with mobility limitations by using only a keyboard to navigate it.

The following strategies were employed to improve seo:

1.Meta Tags:
Every page has meta tags with descriptions and pertinent keywords to increase exposure in search engine results.

2.Descriptive Headings:
Search engines can better comprehend the structure and content of a website when heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) are used appropriately and contain relevant keywords.

3.Descriptive URLs:
Because they are informative and contain pertinent keywords, URLs help search engines comprehend the content of each page.

4.Mobile Optimization:
The website is optimized for mobile devices, improving its search engine ranking as Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites.
